## Description

![Link'D Demo Image](/client/public/project-4_1.gif "Link'D Demo")

This is the 'Software Developer Social Network', a social network app for techies from all fields.
It includes authentication, profile creation, posts and comments.
Building this full stack web application from scratch helped strengthen my understanding of the various aspects of the MERN stack, and how they can be combined to run seamlessly.

This project was inspired by Brad Traversy's "MERN Stack Front To Back" course on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/mern-stack-front-to-back/?couponCode=TRAVERSYMEDIA).
A great course, from which I learned a lot.

## How to run

In the project's root directory, run `npm install` to install all necessary dependencies.

Start the project with `npm start`.

### Live Demo
