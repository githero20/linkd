## Description

This is my version of the MERN stack application from Brad Traversy's "MERN Stack Front To Back" course on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/mern-stack-front-to-back/?couponCode=TRAVERSYMEDIA). It is a social network app that includes authentication, profiles and forum posts.

Building this web application from scratch helped strengthen my understanding of the various aspects of the MERN stack, and how they can be combined to run seamlessly.

Of course, I made some changes to Brad's original code. However, major credit goes to Brad for this great course, from which I learned a lot.

## How to run

In the project's root directory, run `npm install` to install all necessary dependencies.

Start the project with `npm start`.
